# _mesh-vr-reconstruction-and-view_ #
This software were developed in the context of the EspeleoRobô project, supported by Instituto Tecnologico Vale (ITV). The EspeleoRobô is a robot designed to perform inspection in confined areas, such as mines and cavities.


## Mesh Reconstruction Software

### Installation guide
  First, installing all dependencies in a terminal:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libgmp-dev libgmpxx4ldbl libmpfr-dev libpng-dev
  ```
  Then, download [CGAL Library (Version 4.11)!](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/archive/releases/CGAL-4.11.tar.gz) 
  
  Compile the cgal library by going into the unzipped folder and executing the following in a terminal:
 ```bash
 mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake .. ; make ; sudo make install
 ```
 Go to the surface_recon directory of this project and compile the mesh recon software:
```bash
mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake .. ; make
```

### Output
The mesh generated by this algorithm can be readily imported to rendering platforms using .obj format with textures.

## Applications
